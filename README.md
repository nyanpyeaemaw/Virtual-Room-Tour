# 🖥️ Computer Graphics Project – 3D Kitchen Scene

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Computer Graphics application** that demonstrates fundamental 3D graphics concepts through the implementation of a **3D Kitchen Scene**.
The scene is designed to showcase object modeling, transformations, lighting, and rendering techniques commonly taught in computer graphics courses.

The project focuses on building a visually coherent environment while applying theoretical graphics concepts in a practical implementation.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Design and render a complete **3D kitchen environment**
* Apply **geometric transformations** (translation, rotation, scaling)
* Implement **lighting and shading techniques**
* Understand **scene composition and object hierarchy**
* Gain hands-on experience with computer graphics programming

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

* **Programming Language:** Python / C++ (adjust if needed)
* **Graphics Library:** OpenGL / PyOpenGL / GLUT (adjust if needed)
* **IDE / Tools:** VS Code, PyCharm, or equivalent
* **Platform:** Desktop (Windows)

> ⚠️ *Update the technologies section if your stack is different.*

## 🧩 Features

* Fully modeled **3D kitchen scene**
* Multiple kitchen objects (cabinets, table, appliances, etc.)
* Lighting effects for realistic visualization
* Interactive camera or scene navigation (if applicable)
* Structured and modular graphics code
